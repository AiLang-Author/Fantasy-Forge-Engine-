4. **Save at the inn** — This is your respawn point!
5. **Venture out** — Fight monsters, gain XP, level up

## Character Classes

|-------|----|----|-----------|------------|
| **Warrior** | ★★★ | ★ | High damage, tanky | No magic |
| **Mage** | ★ | ★★★ | Powerful spells, AoE | Fragile, needs MP |

| **Cleric** | ★★ | ★★★ | Healing, buffs, undead killer | Weak damage |
| **Ranger** | ★★ | ★★ | Balanced, multi-shot | Master of none |

### Stat Breakdown

| Stat | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **STR** | Physical damage |
| **AGI** | Speed, dodge chance, escape success |
| **VIT** | HP growth, defense |
| **INT** | Magic damage, MP growth |
| **LUK** | Critical hits, item drops |

### Derived Stats

| Stat | Formula |
|------|---------|
| **Attack** | STR + Weapon |
| **Defense** | VIT/2 + Armor |
| **Speed** | AGI (determines turn order) |
| **Magic Atk** | INT |
| **Magic Def** | INT/2 + VIT/4 |

---

## Combat

Combat is turn-based. You and enemies take turns based on **Speed**.

### Your Options

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Attack** | Basic physical attack |
| **Skill** | Use a learned ability (costs MP) |
| **Defend** | Reduce damage taken this turn, +4 AC |
| **Item** | Use a potion or consumable |
| **Flee** | Attempt to escape (not always possible) |

### How Attacks Work

```
Hit Check:    Roll d20 + your Attack vs enemy AC
Damage:       Weapon dice + STR bonus
Critical:     Natural 20 = double damage!
```

### Combat Tips

- **Defend** when low HP and waiting for heals
- **Flee** works better with high AGI (base 30% + AGI×2, max 90%)
- Some zones prevent escape (boss fights, certain dungeons)
- Dying respawns you at the last inn with **1 HP** and **half your gold**
